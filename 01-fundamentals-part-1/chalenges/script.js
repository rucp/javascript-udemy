// Coding Challenge #1
/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.

const markMass1 = 78;
const markHeight1 = 1.69;

const johnMass1 = 92;
const johnHeight1 = 1.95;

const bmiMark1 = markMass1 / markHeight1 ** 2;
const bmiJohn1 = johnMass1 / johnHeight1 ** 2;
console.log('bmiMark: ', bmiMark1, 'bmiJohn: ', bmiJohn1)

const markHigherBMI1 = bmiMark1 > bmiJohn1;
console.log('is mark bmi1 higher', markHigherBMI1);

//

const markMass2 = 95;
const markHeight2 = 1.88;

const johnMass2 = 85;
const johnHeight2 = 1.76;

const bmiMark2 = markMass2 / markHeight2 ** 2;
const bmiJohn2 = johnMass2 / johnHeight2 ** 2;
console.log('bmiMark: ', bmiMark2, 'bmiJohn: ', bmiJohn2)

const markHigherBMI2 = bmiMark2 > bmiJohn2;
console.log('is mark bmi2 higher', markHigherBMI2);
