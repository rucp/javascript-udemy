///////// Coding Challenge #1
/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.
*/

const markMass = 78;
const markHeight = 1.69;
const johnMass = 92;
const johnHeight = 1.95;

// const markMass = 95;
// const markHeight = 1.88;
// const johnMass = 85;
// const johnHeight = 1.76;

const bmiMark = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
const bmiJohn = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
console.log('bmiMark: ', bmiMark, 'bmiJohn: ', bmiJohn)

//////// Coding Challenge #2
// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
// improve it.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement �
// GOOD LUCK 

if (bmiMark > bmiJohn) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI (${bmiMark.toFixed(1)}) is higher than John's (${bmiJohn.toFixed(1)}).`);
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${bmiJohn.toFixed(1)}) is higher than Mark's (${bmiMark.toFixed(1)})`);
}
